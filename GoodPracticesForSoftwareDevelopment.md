# Good practices for software development
## Question 1
**Which point(s) were new to you?**
- Try to find out relevant team member's work schedules, and set up a call when they are free
- Do not miss calls. If you cannot talk immediately, receive the call and inform them you will call in back in 5-10 min, and call them back. This is a much better alternative than letting it go down as a missed call.
- Be available when someone replies to your message. Things move faster if it's a real-time conversation as compared to a back and forth every hour.
- You should strongly consider blocking social media sites and apps during work hours. Tools like TimeLimit, Freedom, or any other app can be helpful.

## Question 2
**Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

***Availability and Responsiveness:***
- Improve availability by setting clear online status and prioritizing communication channels.
- Respond promptly to messages by creating a schedule for checking and responding.
***Time Management and Distraction Control:***
- Enhance time management by using distraction-blocking tools.
- Establish focused work periods and breaks to maintain productivity.

***Scheduling and Call Management:***
- Schedule calls with team members based on their availability.
- Promptly return missed calls to avoid communication gaps.

***Real-time Communication:***
- Encourage real-time conversations using instant messaging.
- Schedule regular check-ins for real-time project discussions and issue resolution.
