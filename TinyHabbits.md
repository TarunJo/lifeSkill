## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message
### Question 2
***How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.*** <br>
The B = MAP formula, introduced by BJ Fogg, simplifies habit creation:
- **Behavior (B)**: The desired habit.
- **Motivation (M)**: Your willingness to do the behavior.
- **Ability (A)**: Your capability to perform the behavior.
- **Prompt (P)**: A cue that triggers the behavior.

This formula helps you establish habits by boosting motivation, simplifying actions, and employing reliable cues. <br>
Example: <br>
After I wash my face in the morning, <br>
I will put sunscreen on it. <br>

### Question 3
***Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)*** <br>
Celebrating success after each habit completion is vital because it reinforces the habit loop, boosts confidence, and motivates you to keep going. It creates "success momentum," 
accelerating habit development from small beginnings to more significant achievements. In short, celebrating small wins is a key factor in building and sustaining habits.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits
### Question 5
***What is the book's perspective about Identity?*** <br>
The book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear talks about how important it is to think of yourself differently when you're trying to make new habits. 
Instead of just focusing on what you want to achieve, the book says you should change how you see yourself. 
It means thinking of yourself as someone who already does the good things you want to do, like eating healthy or exercising regularly. 
This makes it easier to stick to those habits because you feel like it's just part of who you are. In simple words, the book says changing your habits starts with changing how you think about yourself.

### Question 6
***Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?*** <br>
- Start Small: Begin with easy habits to reduce the difficulty.
- Change Your Environment: Set up your surroundings to support the habit, like having books around if you want to read more.
- Habit Stacking: Connect your new habit to something you already do regularly.
- Plan Specifically: Decide when and where you'll do the habit.
- Remove Obstacles: Make it as easy as possible to do the habit.
- Use Technology: Set reminders on your devices to help you remember.
- Reward Yourself: Find ways to enjoy or treat yourself after completing the habit.

### Question 7
***Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?*** <br>
In "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, the main idea is about making habits easier, not harder. 
The book talks a lot about how to create a good environment and mindset to make good habits more simple and appealing. 
It doesn't really talk about making habits tougher to do. It's more about making good habits stick in your daily life.

### Question 8:
***Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?*** <br>
I want to do yoga every morning. Here's how to make it easier and more appealing:
- **Cue (Obvious):** Decide when and where to do yoga, like "I'll do it at 6 AM in the room." Put your mat out the night before.
- **Make It Attractive:** Pick a yoga style which is easy to start. Play calming music or use nice scents to make it enjoyable.
- **Keep It Easy:** Start with short sessions, like 5-10 minutes, and make them longer over time. Follow an online yoga tutorials for help.
- **Reward Yourself:** After yoga, treat yourself to something good, like a yummy breakfast and write down your progress to feel proud.


### Question 9:
***Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?*** <br>
I would like to get rid of over usage of smart phone.
- **Don't See It (Cue Invisible):** Uninstall all the unnecessary things that eat up my time and try to engage myself in other productive activities.
- **Make It Boring (Habit Unattractive):** Make your phone's screen less colorful, so it's not as fun to look at. Also, think about how using your phone too much can mess up your day.
- **Create Hurdles (Make It Hard):** Use an app that limits your time on the phone. Or put your phone somewhere hard to reach, like on a high shelf.
- **Not Fun (Response Unsatisfying):** Imagine all the cool stuff you could do instead of staring at your phone. Keep track of the days when you use your phone less, and give yourself a pat on the back.
